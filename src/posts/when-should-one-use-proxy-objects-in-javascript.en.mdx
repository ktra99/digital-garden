In ECMAScript 6, JavaScript introduced a powerful feature called Proxy objects. A Proxy object is an object that wraps another object and allows you to intercept and customize operations performed on that object. With Proxy objects, you can add custom behavior to objects, change the way they behave, and even prevent certain operations from happening altogether.

So, when should you use Proxy objects in your JavaScript code? Let's explore some use cases.

## Use case 1: Validation

One of the most common use cases for Proxy objects is data validation. When you create a new object, you can use a Proxy to validate that the data being set on the object meets certain requirements.

For example, let's say we have an object representing a person's age:

```JavaScript
const person = { age: 25 };
```

We want to make sure that the age is always a positive integer. We can use a Proxy to intercept any attempts to set the age property, and validate the value being set:

```JavaScript
const person = new Proxy({ age: 25 }, {
  set(target, prop, value) {
    if (prop === 'age') {
      if (typeof value !== 'number' || value < 0) {
        throw new Error('Age must be a positive integer');
      }
    }
    target[prop] = value;
    return true;
  }
});
```

Now, if we try to set the age to a negative value, we'll get an error:

```JavaScript
person.age = -1; // throws "Age must be a positive integer"
```

## Use case 2: Logging

Another use case for Proxy objects is logging. You can use a Proxy to intercept any property access or method calls on an object, and log them for debugging purposes.

For example, let's say we have an object representing a user:

```Javascript
const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
```

We want to log any property access or method call on this object. We can use a Proxy to intercept all these operations and log them to the console:

```Javascript
const user = new Proxy({ name: 'Alice', age: 25 }, {
  get(target, prop, receiver) {
    const value = Reflect.get(target, prop, receiver);
    console.log(`Getting "${prop}": ${value}`);
    return value;
  },
  apply(target, thisArg, args) {
    const result = Reflect.apply(target, thisArg, args);
    console.log(`Calling "${target.name || 'anonymous'}" with arguments: ${args}`);
    return result;
  }
});
```

Now, any property access or method call on the user object will be logged:

```Javascript
user.name; // logs "Getting "name": Alice"
```

It's important to note that while proxies can be a powerful tool, they also add additional complexity to your code, which can make it harder to understand and maintain. As with any programming construct, it's important to use them judiciously and only when they are needed. Understanding their limitations and potential drawbacks is also essential.
