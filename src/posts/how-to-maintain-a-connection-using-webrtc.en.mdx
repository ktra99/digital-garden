# The Basics of WebRTC

---

WebRTC uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture where two peers communicate directly with each other, without going through a central server. This allows for faster and more efficient communication, but it also means that the connection between peers must be maintained by the peers themselves.

# Signaling

---

The first step in establishing a WebRTC connection is signaling. Signaling is the process of exchanging metadata between peers to establish a connection. Metadata includes information such as session descriptions, ICE candidates, and network information.

There are several methods for signaling in WebRTC, including using a signaling server, WebSocket, or another P2P connection. Once the metadata has been exchanged and both peers have a shared understanding of the connection, they can begin sending data to each other.

Here's an example of how to establish a connection using the WebRTC API:

```Javascript
// initialize peer connection
const pc = new RTCPeerConnection();

// add ICE candidate
pc.onicecandidate = event => {
  if (event.candidate) {
    // send ICE candidate to other peer
  }
};

// create data channel
const dataChannel = pc.createDataChannel('data');

// send data
dataChannel.send('Hello, world!');
```

# Handling Disconnects

---

One of the challenges in maintaining a WebRTC connection is handling disconnects. There are many reasons why a peer might disconnect, such as network issues, device shutdown, or user action.

To handle disconnects, it's important to monitor the connection and detect when it has been lost. This can be done using the<Code code="oniceconnectionstatechange"/>event, which fires whenever the ICE connection state changes.

Here's an example of how to detect a disconnect using the WebRTC API:

```Javascript
// detect disconnect
pc.oniceconnectionstatechange = event => {
  if (pc.iceConnectionState === 'disconnected') {
    // handle disconnect
  }
};
```

Once a disconnect has been detected, there are several strategies for handling it. One approach is to try to reconnect the peers by exchanging metadata and establishing a new connection. Another approach is to gracefully terminate the connection and inform the user that the connection has been lost.

# Handling NAT Traversal

---

Another challenge in maintaining a WebRTC connection is NAT traversal. NAT (Network Address Translation) is a technique used by routers to map multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address.

When two peers are behind different NATs, they might not be able to establish a direct connection. In this case, a technique called NAT traversal can be used to establish a connection by routing data through a third-party server.

Once the connection has been established and the necessary data has been exchanged, the peers can begin sending media streams to each other. WebRTC provides APIs for capturing and transmitting media streams, which can be used in conjunction with the signaling server to facilitate communication between peers.

Here's an example of how to capture and transmit a video stream in JavaScript:

```Javascript
// Get the video element from the DOM
const video = document.getElementById('localVideo');

// Get the user's media stream
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true })
  .then(stream => {
    // Attach the media stream to the video element
    video.srcObject = stream;

    // Create a new RTCPeerConnection
    const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection();

    // Add the user's media stream to the peer connection
    stream.getTracks().forEach(track => {
      peerConnection.addTrack(track, stream);
    });

    // Create an offer to send to the remote peer
    peerConnection.createOffer()
      .then(offer => {
        // Set the local description of the peer connection
        return peerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer);
      })
      .then(() => {
        // Send the offer to the remote peer via the signaling server
        signalingServer.sendOffer(peerConnection.localDescription);
      });
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

In this example, we first get the video element from the DOM and request access to the user's media stream using the<Code code="navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()"/>method. We then attach the media stream to the video element.

Next, we create a new<Code code="RTCPeerConnection"/>and add the user's media stream to it using the<Code code="addTrack()"/>method. We then create an offer using the<Code code="createOffer()"/>method and set the local description of the peer connection using the<Code code="setLocalDescription()"/>method.

Finally, we send the offer to the remote peer via the signaling server using the<Code code="sendOffer()"/>method.
