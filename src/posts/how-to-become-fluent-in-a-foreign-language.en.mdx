There are four aspects of a language.

1. Reading
2. Listening
3. Writting
4. Speaking

I believe fluency within a language comes from mastering all four aspects. In order to know where you stand in the spectrum,
you can use the proficiency guideline [CEFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages). The guideline was initially used across europe but has since been used increasingly
in other areas of the world. CEFR provides a range of reference levels between A1-C2, where each letter consist of 2 levels.

During the rest of this post I will be going over the steps I took when I first started to learn vietnamese.

I started off by taking a proficiency test in order to evaluate my current fluency within the language. I found a quick and easy test [here](https://www.17-minute-languages.com/en/Vietnamese-placement-test/).
The test results indicated that I knew approximately 1200 words which corresponds to an A1 level proficiency.

Obviously I had a lot of ground to cover before I could reach my destination. So in order to take on this challenge I created a framework for myself and I set a deadline of 1 year.
Learning something new often derives from creating connections between things we have learned in the past along with new information we take in.

My framework consist of three parts. The first part consist of building repertoire. A language can be broken down into words and alphabets. In order to become more fluent in a language
you need to be able to use a vast majority of words and terminology. That is why the first part of the framework revolves around utilizing a content stream to build repertoire.

The second part of the framework is more oriented towards grammar. Once I've built enough repertoire and I have more vocabulary, the next step is to learn how to use words to formulate myself.

If you have had the chance to study a new language during your education, you may be familiar with how things are structured in a class environment. The teacher would go over certain exercises and grammar
from various textbooks and you would get an exam towards the end of the class.

I believe the traditional way of learning a new language especially for grasping the grammer, can be very effective and I would highly recommend leaning towards a textbook of sort to become
more familiar with the grammar of a particular language.

Here's the [book](https://www.routledge.com/Colloquial-Vietnamese-The-Complete-Course-for-Beginners/Hoai-Tran-Nguyen-Vuong-Vuong/p/book/9781138950238) I used for reference.
I'm a big fan of the [Routledge Colloquials](https://routledgetextbooks.com/textbooks/colloquial/) collection and chances are that they have a similar book for the language that you are looking to learn.

The third and last part of the framework is to apply the language into your everyday life.
