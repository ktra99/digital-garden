Web development consist of two main parts. We have the frontend and the backend. There's a lot of job opportunities within these two areas alone. I will be going through 3 career paths and share a personalized checklist for each corresponding career path.

## 1. &nbsp; Web designer

As a web designer, you're primarly focused on the look and feel of a website.
You are a creative person with a passion towards great design and user experience. In order to become a web designer you must familiarize yourself with design tools and principles.

Unlike a UX designer, you're more tech oriented and your work revolves around
constructing websites rather than innovating great user experience. This doesn't
mean that they are both mutually exclusive, sometimes both of those areas may
overlap. But generally speaking, a web designer tends to work more extensivly
with building out wireframes and architecting the user flow for websites.

Here's my personalized checklist for becoming a web designer -

  }

## 2. &nbsp; Frontend developer

As a frontend developer, you'll be working on developing the infrastructure
of a website. You'll be responsible for communicating with the design team
and carry out the functionality of a website in order to enhance the user
experience. As a person you're very eager to try new things. Staying up to
date with the latest technology will help you become a valuable developer in
the market.

Whether you build websites through a CMS like WordPress or develop from scratch
using a web framework like Next.js, it's important that you're able to adjust
and use the technology stack that is best suited for the project. Being a
frontend developer means that you get to be very hands-on with the code.

Here's my personalized checklist for becoming a frontend developer -

<Checkbox
  header={"Pick up basic web development skills"}
  excerpt={
    "Start learning HTML, CSS and Javascript to build up your foundation."
  }

<Checkbox

  }

<Checkbox

    "Getting a grasp of how the command line works can help you become a more effecient developer."
  }

<Checkbox

  }
/>
<Checkbox
  header={"Work on your Github profile"}
  excerpt={
    "Your Github profile is a great way to demonstrate your OSS contributions as well as your previous work."
  }
/>

## 3. &nbsp; Backend developer

As a backend developer, you'll be handling queries between clients and servers. Your primary job is to manage the data flow of a website. Whether that may be setting up a relational schema for storing data or creating API endpoints for resource allocation.
Working on the backend means that you'll be on the logistical side of the development process.
